# AC_Valhalla_CheatEngine_speedhack
Cheat table for Assassinâ€™s Creed Valhalla. Inside this script you can choose speed of the game after specified button will be pressed. I created it because basic "Speed hack" from cheat engine did not work at all. 

# Credits 
Credits to Jintohaku from nexusmods for the idea. His cheat table did not sped up the game in my case (there was an error) but gave me an idea and hope to create it. 
Here is link to his mod: nexusmods.com/assassinscreedvalhalla/mods/274?tab=posts
